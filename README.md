##### **Milestone 1: Refine Data**
- Remove unnecessary fields
- Sort Data by Country Name and Year
##### **Milestone 2: Analyze Data**
- Find which top 5 countries have the most frequent & highest suicide rate in the past 5 years
- Find which countries are Excluded
##### **Milestone 3: Predict**
- Predict Suicide Rate at the Top 5 Countries

### Conclusion
- The top 2 country predicted to have increasing suicide rate in the next 5 years based on linear regression are:
    - COUNTRY,LSO,Lesotho,REGION,AFR,Africa
